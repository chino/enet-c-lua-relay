make separate sleep, io.ready, and proxy modules that can be loaded dynamically or statically.

support multiple connections in the proxy.

make proxy use a module style such as connection=proxy:new(); connection:send(data) etc.

a string lookup table for network_state_t could be used, or perhaps map obl.connected and obl.connecting properties ?

define c99 booleans in the c code.

add mingw cross compiler mode to the make file to produce win32 binaries ?

use a documentation system to generate docs ?

proxy should support passing new/lost connection events and network_packet_t should provide host/port information for the data packets.

chat.c could be broken down into more files for cleaner look
